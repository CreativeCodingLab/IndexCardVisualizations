The following document shows TimeArcs visualization for Pathway Commons index cards. 

Time axis goes from left (2000) to right (2014). An arc connects two proteins/complexes at a particular time (based on when the interaction was discovered/ publication year). The colors encode interaction types: green for adds_modification, red for removes_modification, blue for translocation, orange for binds, and pink for increases. A black (and usually thicker) arcs indicates multiple interactions between two proteins/complexes are discovered in the same year (and probably in the same publication). The horizontal lines connect multiple occurrences of the same proteins/complexes in different publications.

When there are multiple connections (arcs) between two proteins/complexes, it may falls into one of the two following circumstances:
