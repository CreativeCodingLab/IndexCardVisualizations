# IndexCardVisualizations
Home of FRIES/PathwayCommon IndexCard alignment visualizations 

The following document shows TimeArcs visualization for Pathway Commons index cards. 
Time axis goes from left (2000) to right (2014). An arc connects two proteins/complexes at a particular time (based on when the interaction was discovered/ publication year). The colors encode interaction type: green for adds_modification, red for removes_modification, blue for translocation, orange for binds, and pink for increases. A black arcs indicates multiple interactions between two proteins/complexes are discovered in the same year (and probably in the same publication)
